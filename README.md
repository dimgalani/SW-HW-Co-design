# SW-HW-Co-design
This repository contains the C++ files and the reports for the lab of the "Architecture of Advanced Computers and Accelerators" course offered in the 7th semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It includes both kernel and host programs for implementing matrix multiplication on an FPGA. As part of the lab, the programs were only simulated and emulated, without being tested on an actual FPGA platform.
